# WineQualityRegression
Wine Quality Data Set: In this example I want to train a regression model in order to predict the quality level of different wines. The model is based on the famous wine data set.

# 1. Data Split:
For my model I have splitted the data into Training Data (80%), Test Data (10%) and Validation Data.

# 2. Training of the models
I have trained the 4 Models with the training data, (Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Supported Vector Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression)

# 3. Comparing the Modles by their MSE
For visualization purposes, I have plotted the MSE of the models in a bar chart.

# 4. Choosing the best model and run it again on the validation data
Random Forest Regression has perfomred as the best model, based on its smallest MSE
